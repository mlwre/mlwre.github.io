title: Welcome to MLWRE
---

We are a **non-profit association** dedicated to researching and analyzing Internet threats. We're not just a blog—we're a global community of researchers who've been working together for over a decade.

## Who we are

We are more than **100 researchers** spread across the globe, united by our passion for making the Internet a safer place. We focus on:

- Researching and analyzing malware and digital threats
- Collaborating with public organizations, companies, and State Security Forces
- Creating a neutral space to share knowledge among cybersecurity experts
- Organizing our **annual conference** in Palma de Mallorca (we've been doing it for over 10 years)
- Working hand in hand with CERTs and specialized international teams

## What we do

We don't just scratch the surface. We analyze samples, publish reports, organize workshops and technical talks, and above all, **we share knowledge**. Because we believe digital security is everyone's business.

We've run services like our malware zoo in the past, and who knows—it might rise from the ashes like a phoenix soon.

## Our philosophy

We're a vetted, non-profit community focused on serious research but with a human touch. Here you'll find technical analysis, but also real stories from the cybersecurity trenches.

**Welcome to the trenches.**
