## Our services

We've run services like our malware zoo in the past, where we analyzed, classified, and reported on malware samples from multiple public and private sources. Who knows—it might rise from the ashes like a phoenix soon.

We are more than **100 researchers** spread across the globe. A vetted, non-profit community where knowledge is shared and research is serious but accessible.
