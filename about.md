Hello friend, we are a non-profit organisation and vetted community focused on malware and threat analysis, comprised by members of the Spanish malware research community.

We have just set up this blog instance to start publishing indicators and reports extracted from our feed.

As part of our activities we run services, among them, a malware zoo ( https://zoo.mlw.re ) for members of the malware research community, that analyses, classifies and reports on malware samples from a number of public and non-public feeds and self made crawlers, and also allows free downloading of the analysed samples.



Enjoy!
