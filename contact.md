## Join us

Interested in becoming part of our community? We're always looking for researchers, professionals, and experts in cybersecurity who share our passion for making the Internet a safer place.

## Conference

Our annual conference in Palma de Mallorca is an invitation-only event. Not everyone is eligible—you need to be recommended by someone in our community. If you've been recommended, we'll be delighted to welcome you into our fold. For questions about the conference, please contact us through the email above.

## Collaboration

We're open to collaborations with CERTs, security organizations, and research institutions. Don't hesitate to reach out if you'd like to work together.

## Partnerships, Participation & Sponsorships

We're always looking to collaborate on new initiatives, develop something cool, or participate in interesting projects. Got an idea? Let's talk.

So far, we've been paying for everything ourselves—and we're proud of that. But we want to grow, and we're always eager to explore new opportunities.

If you're a company, organization, or just someone who wants to help, we're open to:
- **Donations** - Every bit helps us keep doing what we do
- **Licenses** - Software licenses we can use for research and analysis
- **Cloud resources** - Infrastructure that helps us scale our work
- **Hardware** - Equipment that enables our research

We're always up for a conversation about sponsorships and partnerships. No corporate speak, no buzzwords—just real talk about how we can work together to make the Internet a safer place.
